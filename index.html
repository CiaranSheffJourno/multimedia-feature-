I heard about supper clubs on Radio 4. They sounded mysterious, and veiled in culinary shadows. As noir as food is ever likely to get. And because I heard about them on Radio 4 I assumed they must be important. The idea didn’t seem new exactly - a bit like a dinner party. But, as well as this, they were helping people to meet and overcome loneliness. I was lonely. I decided to find one.
             </p>

I sought out Kersten Rodgers (who blogs under the name MsMarmiteLover). In 2009, she founded “The Underground Restaurant”, one of the first supper clubs. It was located in her London home, which became a makeshift restaurant, with people flocking in; drooling over spinach and ricotta cannelloni while her family were going about day to day life. A food blogger, she used it as an outlet to share her passion. She suggested I read her book.

</p>
<p> In “Supper Club” she describes the home restaurant: “It is as if the TV programmes Come Dine With Me has mated with Masterchef and Through the Keyhole.” At home restaurants you are inhabiting someone else’s space, mixing the public and private. As well as the home restaurant, supper clubs can be pop ups in restaurants or bars. Many of the events are put on by chefs or foodies, who use it to experiment in a way they can’t during their day job: basing a whole menu on marmite, or doing charming things with cauliflowers. </p>

<h2> Searching for Heart and Parcel </h2>

I needed some more information. I spoke to Clare Courtney, who, along with Karolina Koscien, is one of the founders of Heart and Parcel in Manchester. It’s a supper club with a difference. It was created initially to raise awareness of an important social issue: the lack of funds available for women in the migrant community to learn English. Food was a way of doing this. In ESOL classes Clare and Karolina make dumplings with the women, and develop their English skills in this communal way.

  </p>
    <p>
Clare thought that the essence of supper clubs was the local nature: “I think it’s quite grassroots and community centred, and I think that’s what’s special about supper clubs. There’s always some other meaning behind it.” For Heart and Parcel their supper clubs have deep meaning, because they are helped by the women they teach. At the events they sell these carefully crafted dumplings on themed nights: Chinese dumplings, Polish, Syrian. Clare began with just six people in her house, and later she moved into pop up events for as many as forty. Eventually one of the women from Syria, Laila, even hosted her own.

  </p>If you want to choose a supper club, there are a surprising number of options. There was a Beauty and the Beast themed option, with mixed reviews. There was a Sunday lunch, which sounded appealing, but I wanted to try something a bit different. There was something called Nuclear Winter, which promised to show me “life behind the iron curtain”. I was quite happy to let it remain behind the iron curtain. The one I chose sounded a bit weird, small, and experimental. I liked it already. It was called “How to eat your Christmas tree”.

    <h2> Entering the world of the supper club
</h2>

            <p>Emerging from a lift onto the top floor of an affluent-feeling apartment building I was greeted at the door by Julia. Our host. She guided me into the living room. A modern open plan, with a black and white zig-zag carpet, a bookcase and record collection. A few people were in the living room with drinks. In the far-right hand corner was a long wooden table, decorated with acorns and candles and chairs for ten people. </p>

            <p> As we sat down Julia gave us an introduction. She did this for each of the four courses. Telling us not just what we would be eating, but how it was made. This gave the whole evening a personal touch that you don’t get in restaurants. In every course there was some Christmas tree element, with fir or spruce added, whether through smoking, pickling, or thrown like darts.

              <blockquote>
                "In every course there was some Christmas tree element" <br> ~ <em></em>
              </blockquote>

            </p> Julia was cooking in a little kitchen just opposite one end of the table. With no help she carried the food out herself. The starter was a beetroot and spruce cured salmon, spruce pickled vegetables, and homemade rye bread. The salmon was rich and lemony. But the highlights were the vegetables, the beetroot and carrot, which zinged with sweetness.

            <p>
As well as food, part of what makes supper clubs a unique experience are the guests. There were ten people of different ages and nationalities. The woman sitting next to me was from San Francisco. She had only just moved to London to start a new job, and this was a good way to meet new people in a foreign city. Sitting opposite me was a primary teacher, who had brought her grandmother (or, possibly, mother) along as a secret-santa gift.

</p> Without sounding like the “Guardian dates” section, as a group we bonded over the random mix of topics that you get when you bring disparate people together: bad history; a recent Rio Ferdinand documentary; Orpington chickens. And normal things too: books, what food we like and the geography of London (“Where is Camberwell?”).

            <p> Simply though, food itself is a great way to get people talking. And that’s what we found, particularly with the pudding. A blue spruce ice cream. This, Julia said, was her favourite. For the guests though, opinions ranged from “it tastes like putting my face in a Christmas tree”; “it tastes like eating a pine cone air freshener” to “it tastes like something you put in the bath”. I actually liked it though. And, I appreciated all the effort that had gone into it, since I never for a moment thought you could eat a Christmas tree.


            <p>In searching for supper clubs, the world I found was full of passionate people. Making a big difference, or just bringing people together for a night in a city. And I didn’t have to look too far or do too much detective work. They are popping up all over the country, creating an unusual, more personal, memorable form of dining.
